SDK for interacting with Rancher Server using Java
--------------------------------------------------

This project is a autogenerated Java Client for [Rancher](rancher.com)

This project automatically generates the type definitions using a Go template generator and the Rancher provided API schema.
It was originally derived from the [Go-Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/go-rancher) library.

There services definitions are built using Square's [Retrofit2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) library.

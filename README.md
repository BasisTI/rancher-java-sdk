SDK for interacting with Rancher Server using Java
--------------------------------------------------

This project is a autogenerated Java Client for [Rancher](rancher.com)

This project automatically generates the type definitions using a Go template generator and the Rancher provided API schema.
It was originally derived from the [Go-Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/go-rancher) library.

There services definitions are built using Square's [Retrofit2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) library.

Rancher API version: v2-beta

Please see: https://github.com/objectpartners/rancher-java-sdk

## Example

That entry point for this library is the `io.rancher.Rancher` class.
You must first create an API key in your Rancher installation for this library to use.

First, initialize your Rancher client:

```java
Rancher.Config config = new Rancher.Config(new URL("https://rancher.mydomain.com"), "MyAPIAccessKey", "MyAPISecretKey");
Rancher rancher = new Rancher(config);
```

Once the client is created, you can interact with Rancher by having the client generate a proxy for one of the service
interfaces for you.

```java
StackService stackService = rancher.type(StackService.class);
Response<io.rancher.base.TypeCollection<Stack>> execute = stackService.list().execute();
List<Stack> stacks = execute.body().getData();
```
